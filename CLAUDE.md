# Aurum88 Protocol — project context for Claude Code

A bring-your-own-keys **gold-macro app**: a single 0–100 Gold Index (real yields, USD, central-bank
demand, inflation, technicals) + a forward signal, history chart, AI brief, news, and a second
instrument (the Dollar / DXY via the HMAI engine). No backend; runs on-device.

> **Forward Signal v2 (2026-07, ships in v2.1.0):** the 3-6M outlook was rebuilt after a full
> backtest vs real 2005-2026 history — now 0.55 Real-Rate Regime (DFII10 level, HIGH = bullish)
> + 0.25 12M Trend + 0.20 Fed Cycle (DGS2 Δ); needs FRED DGS2 + a 6y DFII10 fetch (wired in
> DataRepository). The old delta-based signal measured IC ≈ −0.05 (its BEARISH months out-returned
> its BULLISH ones); v2 measures IC +0.30/+0.38 train/test. The spot index was validated as a
> *nowcast* and deliberately left unchanged. Methodology, numbers and reproduction:
> **`research/README.md`**. Independently re-audited 2026-07-10 vs fresh LBMA data — all claims
> reproduced, no math changes; v2.2.0 ships the audit's two adjustments (CB 2025 fallback 863 t,
> spot-HOT caution chip). See **`research/VALIDATION_2026-07-10.md`** (incl. live watch-item:
> v2 stayed BULLISH through the 2026 −24% crash).

> **This file is the cross-machine source of truth.** Claude Code's memory is per-machine and does
> **not** sync. When working from a different computer (e.g. a Mac for the iOS build), this committed
> file — plus the docs it points to — is the context. Keep it current.

## Platforms & status
- **Android** — live on Google Play: v2.0.0 / versionCode 6. **v2.1.0 / versionCode 7** (Forward
  Signal v2 + conditions labels; carries the KMP `:shared` core) is on Play **internal testing**.
  **v2.1.1 / versionCode 8** (Clear Cache also busts the 7-day CB feed cache) merged to `master`
  2026-07-03 — signed AAB built, awaiting Play upload. See `release-2.1/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
  **v2.2.0 / versionCode 9** (2026-07-10 audit adjustments: bundled CB 2025 fallback 1000→863 t
  WGC actual + spot-HOT caution chip near the Forward Signal) merged to `master` 2026-07-12 —
  not yet built/uploaded.
- **iOS** — parked for now (Apple App Store). Architecture + phased plan in **`ios/APPLE_RELEASE_PLAN.md`**.
  Decision: **Kotlin Multiplatform shared core + native SwiftUI**. Needs a Mac (Xcode is macOS-only).
  **Phase 1 code is on `master`** (rode the v2.1.0 merge): `:shared` KMP module with **the entire
  domain — `model` + both engines (`GoldIndexEngine` + HMAI) — in `commonMain`**; 29/29 tests green.
  When iOS resumes: network clients → Ktor, storage/biometric → expect/actual, tests → commonTest,
  then iOS targets + SwiftUI on the Mac (Phase 2).

## Repo layout
- `app/` — Android app (Kotlin). Holds `network/`, `data/`, `ui/` (engines now live in `:shared`).
- `shared/` — KMP module (added on `ios-port`). `commonMain` now has the **full domain** (`model/`,
  `domain/gold/` + `domain/hmai/`) and `util/formatDecimals` (expect/actual); deps: kotlinx-datetime.
  `androidTarget` only for now; iOS targets get enabled on the Mac (Phase 2). The app depends on `:shared`.
- `data/cb_quarterly.json` (hosted CB feed) · `release-2.0/` (v2.0 docs) · `ios/` (Apple plan) ·
  `cb-data/` (CB feed tool) · `research/` (Gold Index backtest: scripts + results; `cache/` gitignored,
  regenerate via `research/README.md`).
- **Target:** all engines + `model/` + `network/` in `shared/commonMain` (one source of truth);
  `app/` (Android UI) and `ios/` (SwiftUI UI) on top.

## Build / test the shared module
```bash
./gradlew :shared:assembleDebug          # build the KMP android artifact
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest         # 29 engine tests (still run from :app for now)
```

## Branch model
- `master` — stable mainline for **both** platforms; always shippable.
- Big/risky work goes on a **temporary feature branch**, validated, then merged to `master`
  (e.g. `release-2.0` did this for v2.0; the iOS port uses **`ios-port`**).
- One repo, one `master` — never split Android and iOS onto separate long-lived branches (it would
  fork the shared core).

## Build / test (Android, from repo root)
```bash
source /home/sun/option_android/android_env.sh   # this Linux box only
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug                      # debug build
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest                  # 29 engine tests (Gold Index 19 + HMAI 10)
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease                       # signed Play AAB (needs keystore.properties)
```

## Conventions
- **Commits are attributed to `aurum88p`. Do NOT add a `Co-Authored-By:` / Claude trailer.**
- **Distribution is store-only** (Google Play / App Store). **Never commit an APK/AAB** — `*.apk` /
  `*.aab` are gitignored. Testers onboard by email → see `TESTING.md`.
- **Secrets** live in `keystore.properties` (gitignored); never commit keys/keystores.
- The CB feed is a **git-pushed data file** read from `master` — update via
  `cb-data/cb_update.py … --push` (no app release). See `cb-data/README.md`.
